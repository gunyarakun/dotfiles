# Technical Art For Three.js Apps And Games

Use this reference before premium/AAA/showcase graphics work, shader/material/post-processing changes, VFX systems, generated/imported asset cleanup, LOD/instancing work, or any visual pass that could affect browser performance.

Technical art bridges art direction and real-time constraints. The goal is
readable authored detail that survives active interaction, mobile viewports,
and WebGL budgets.

Research basis: Three.js exposes renderer diagnostics through `WebGLRenderer.info`; `InstancedMesh` is designed for many objects sharing geometry/materials; `LOD` switches objects by distance; `KTX2Loader` supports Basis Universal GPU texture workflows; MDN WebGL best practices emphasize eliminating errors, understanding system limits, eager deletion, batching draw calls, per-pixel VRAM budgets, smaller back buffers, mipmaps, compressed textures, and high-DPI discipline.

## Technical Art Brief

Before implementation, write:

- Art direction in renderable terms: shapes, materials, lighting, VFX, camera, UI/world motifs.
- Hero surfaces: what must look authored at active-play distance.
- Support surfaces: what can be procedural, instanced, simplified, or culled.
- Material kit: named roles, not one-off colors.
- VFX language: event-driven effects and state readability.
- Lighting stack: key/fill/rim/practical/contact/depth.
- Render budget target: draw calls, triangles, textures, materials, DPR, shadow/post cost.
- Asset strategy: procedural / generated 2D / generated 3D / hybrid / imported.
- Mobile constraint: what changes first if performance or readability fails.

## Render Budget Starting Points

These are starting contracts, not universal limits — measure on the target game, and document every deliberate overrun as a tradeoff. The canvas inspector (`pnpm inspect:canvas`) compares live diagnostics against the same numbers and reports over-budget rows.

| Metric (worst active-play view) | Desktop tier | Mobile tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Draw calls (`info.render.calls`) | <= 300 | <= 150 |
| Triangles (`info.render.triangles`) | <= 750k | <= 300k |
| Geometries (`info.memory.geometries`) | <= 300 | <= 200 |
| Textures (`info.memory.textures`) | <= 60 | <= 40 |
| Texture memory (est.) | <= 256 MB | <= 128 MB |
| Shadow-casting lights | <= 2 | 1 |
| Shadow map size | <= 2048 | <= 1024 |
| DPR cap | 2 | 1.5-2 |
| Post passes (beyond render+output) | <= 2 | 0-1 |

How to spend within them:

- Draw calls: repeated world/detail pieces should be instanced or merged by material.
- Triangles: spend on silhouettes near the camera; reduce background detail through LOD, impostors, or simplified meshes.
- Materials: share material roles aggressively. Unique material count often grows faster than geometry count.
- Textures: keep opaque large images compressed or small; avoid unique 2K+ textures for tiny repeated props.
- Shadows: reserve real shadows for hero objects and grounding anchors; use blob/contact meshes for small repeated props (see `references/shader-cookbook.md` for the cheap contact-shadow recipe).
- Post: every pass must earn its cost and preserve interaction clarity; concrete
  chain settings are in `references/shader-cookbook.md`.

Always report actual renderer diagnostics after the graphics pass: calls, triangles, geometries, textures, material count if available, post passes, shadow settings, DPR cap, and bottlenecks.

## Material And Shader System

Use a material kit of named shared roles, not one-off colors. Reuse each role across every mesh that plays the same part:

- `bodyPrimary`: dominant player/world shell.
- `bodySecondary`: panel contrast.
- `trim`: rails, bevel highlights, borders, edge highlights.
- `hazard`: danger surfaces, damage cues, warning stripes.
- `reward`: collectible surfaces with readable value.
- `shieldBoost`: shield, boost, and status states.
- `glass`: cockpit, shield, lens, visor.
- `emissiveSignal`: authored glow strips, status lights, beacon cores.
- `groundContact`: dark matte surfaces and shadow receivers.
- `decalDark` and `decalLight`: panel lines, scratches, numbers, icons.
- UI/world signal colors shared between HUD and diegetic markers.

Use `MeshStandardMaterial` for most surfaces. Use `MeshPhysicalMaterial` selectively for cockpit glass, clearcoat panels, iridescent shields, or premium hero details. Share materials across repeated meshes.

Build procedural material variation from shared causes rather than unrelated
noise in every channel:

1. Choose stable object, world, or UV coordinates at the correct physical
   scale.
2. Derive structural masks such as panels, seams, edges, cavities, or height.
3. Assign material identities, then apply causal modifiers such as wear,
   moisture, age, heat, or exposure.
4. Derive color, roughness, normal, metalness, and emission from those shared
   causes so the channels tell the same surface story.
5. Filter or fade microdetail with distance to prevent shimmer and noise.

Expose perceptual controls such as wear amount, edge width, wetness, or detail
scale, plus useful mask/channel debug views. A reduced quality tier may simplify
detail or resolution, but must preserve the mechanism that gives the material
its identity.

Shader or `onBeforeCompile` work must have a reason:

- State readability: shield ripple, heat, cloak, damage pulse.
- Surface identity: water, forcefield, hologram, scanline, energy core.
- Performance: cheap procedural variation instead of many textures.
- Composition: separating player/threat/reward from background.

Reject shader work that only adds noise, bloom bait, or hidden cost without improving active-play decisions. When shader work is justified, use the proven recipes in `references/shader-cookbook.md` (material values, onBeforeCompile patterns, sky, post chain) instead of improvising GLSL.

## VFX Readability

Every VFX effect must answer:

- What event or state triggers it?
- What does it tell the player?
- Does it point to player, threat, reward, objective, or impact?
- How long does it last?
- Is it pooled or cheap to recreate?
- Does it obscure collision, HUD, or the next decision?
- Is there a reduced-motion fallback for heavy shake/strobe?

Use event-driven VFX over permanent particle clutter:

- Pickup: ring contraction, shard burst, score trail, brief HUD echo.
- Hit/fail: impact ring, debris, damage flash, brief hit pause, camera impulse.
- Boost/speed: engine trail, lane streaks, FOV ease, side streaks, audio pitch.
- Near miss/combo: side spark, line snap, badge pulse, streak counter.
- Shield/invulnerable: refractive shell, rim pulse, absorbed-impact ripple, material swap.
- Spawn/despawn: anticipation pulse, telegraph, dissolve or scale snap.

Pool effects and reuse geometries/materials. Permanent particle fields must stay cheap and sparse.

## Instancing, LOD, And Culling

Use instancing for many copies with the same geometry/material and different transforms: windows, bolts, lane markers, city lights, debris, foliage-like props, stars, crowd cards, track panels, repeated pickups, background modules.

Rules:

- Update `instanceMatrix.needsUpdate` and `instanceColor.needsUpdate` only after batched changes.
- Compute or update bounds for instanced groups when transforms change materially.
- Do not instance everything blindly. Different materials or constantly changing transforms can erase the win.
- Keep collision separate from instanced visual detail.

Use LOD when:

- A hero/background object spans large distance ranges.
- The silhouette matters near camera but not far away.
- Imported/generated models are heavier than needed for background use.

Rules:

- Add hysteresis or distance gaps to reduce visible popping.
- Use impostor cards or simplified silhouettes for far layers when appropriate.
- Verify LOD transitions during real camera motion, not only a static inspection.

## Generated And Imported Asset Cleanup

For every Mint-generated or imported GLB/FBX hero asset:

- Confirm scale, pivot, forward/up orientation, bounds, and active-play silhouette.
- Create a simple collision proxy independent from the visual mesh.
- Inspect file size, approximate triangles, mesh count, material count, texture count, and animation clips when available.
- Replace or simplify excessive materials and textures.
- Add LOD or simplified background variant when reused many times.
- Verify PBR material readability under the game's lighting, not only in a model viewer.
- Keep Mint MCP calls, raw asset handles, and internal URLs out of browser
  runtime code. Prefer stable project paths for downloadable assets; keep the
  explicit Mint world RAD `runtimeUrl` remote as described in
  `../../../references/mint-world-splats.md`.

## Decals, Trim, And Surface Detail

Prefer reusable surface systems:

- Canvas-generated trim sheets for panel lines, markings, arrows, numbers.
- Thin offset decal meshes for hazard marks, faction symbols, lane glyphs, scuffs.
- Shared small textures for noise/wear rather than unique full-size images.
- Procedural UV-independent detail for repeated hard-surface props.

Surface detail must reinforce scale, function, faction, route, or state. Do not add random lines everywhere.

## Color And Readability

Readability beats palette consistency:

- Threats differ from rewards by shape and motion, not only hue.
- Interactables differ from background by silhouette/value/material.
- UI signal colors match world signal colors.
- Bloom/fog/darkness cannot be the primary separator.
- Colorblind-risk information has shape/icon/motion backup.
